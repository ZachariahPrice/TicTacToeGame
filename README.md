# TicTacToeGame

## Hello and welcome to my TicTacToe game, this was made during week 6 of the react MIT course.

### How to use

It works like any normal TicTacToe game, clicking the squares will display either the X or O, depending on if you're player X or O. The game always starts with player X of course, just like in the real life game and has a winner text show up when you have won the game. 

### Roadmap for future improvement

- Add more to the functionality so that the player X and O can't replace their pieces on the board. So for example, I click a square and it belongs to O, X is able to click it as well and it changes to X, which obviously isn't supposed to happen. 
- Change the overall design so that the "next player" is easier to read than that dark red and the winner text colour would be changed also. Could even make the winner of the game an alert, so you can actually tell if someone won or not.
